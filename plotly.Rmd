# Loading data

```{r}
data("instacart")

instacart1 = 
  instacart %>% 
  select(order_id, product_id, user_id, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, aisle, department_id, department) %>% 
  sample_n(5000)
  
  
```

# Plot 1

```{r}
instacart1 %>% 
  group_by(department) %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  mutate(department = factor(department),
         department = fct_reorder(department, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~department, y = ~n, color = ~department, type = "bar",

  )
```

**why cannot order department by number of aisles?**


```{r}
instacart1 %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = factor(aisle),
         aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~aisle, y = ~n, color = ~aisle, type = "bar",
    colors = "viridis"
  )
```

# Plot 2

```{r}
instacart1 %>% 
  mutate(department = factor(department),
         department = fct_reorder(department, order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
